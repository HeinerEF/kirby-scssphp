# The .gitattributes file is similar in that it ignores files. However it doesn't ignore files completely from the repo, but instead just from the ZIP download and the installation via Composer. It should contain files that are needed in the repo, but not for use of the plugin (e.g. unit and integration tests, the dotfiles like .gitignore and .gitattributes itself, scripts for development etc.). It is optional and only needed for that last step. Again, don't ignore any files that are needed for your plugin. Otherwise the ZIP download and Composer installation methods won't work.
