# SCSSPHP Plugin

The **SCSSPHP plugin** for Kirby creates the corresponding "**\*.css** file" from a "**\*.scss** file" and automatically integrates it into the invisible <HEAD\> area of the website via the stylesheet link `<?php snippet('scss') ?>` line.
The "**\*.scss** file" can, of course, include any number of additional "**\*.scss** files" using *`@import "..."`* in accordance with the Sass rules, which are also evaluated by the plugin.

The plugin can automatically detect whether one of the "**\*.scss** files" used has been changed and then regenerates the "**\*.css** file." Otherwise, only the stylesheet link line with the last generated "**\*.css** file" is provided.

It is possible to create different SCSSs for each Kirby template. Just use the name of your template file for the SCSS file (e.g. `article.scss` for `templates/article.php`), and place it in `assets/scss`. If no SCSS file for a template can be found, `default.scss` will be used.

When the website is accessed by someone logged-in with the role of a `admin`, a detailed "**\*.css** file" is used, which also links to the corresponding SourceMap. This detailed "**\*.css** file" can be examined in detail in the browser, for example with <F12\>.
All other visitors receive a compressed "**\*.css** file".
You can change these roles in the *config* via the `heineref.scssphp.scssDeveloperRoles` option.

It is also possible to use a SCSS file for other media by adding another call such as "`<?php snippet('scss', ['scss' => 'print', 'media' => 'print']); ?>`" into the invisible <HEAD\> area of the website.

This Kirby plugin uses the **SCSSPHP library** https://scssphp.github.io/scssphp/ written in PHP, which was originally developed by *Leaf Corcoran* and is now maintained by *Anthon Pang* and *CÃ©dric Morin*.

**Optionally** you can use this Kirby plugin to generate '*critical CSS*'. Please look at *`README_critical_CSS.md`* for details.

## Installation

### Download

[Download](https://github.com/heineref/kirby-scssphp/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository as Zip file.


Rename the **extracted** folder to `heineref_scssphp` and copy it into the `site/plugins/` directory in your Kirby project.
This file `README.md` therefore receives the path `site/plugins/heineref_scssphp/README.md`.

### Git submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/heineref/kirby-scssphp.git site/plugins/heineref_scssphp
```

### Composer

```
composer require heineref/scssphp
```

## Setup

1. Make sure you backup your original CSS files **beforehand**.
2. Create a folder `scss` inside the `/assets` folder.
3. Create a file `default.scss` with some content and place it inside `assets/scss`.
4. Make sure the folder `/assets/css` exists on your server.
5. Add `'scssNestedCheck' => true` to the config of your **dev environment**. [Read more about multi environment setup for Kirby](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/configuration#multi-environment-setup).
6. Call the SCSS snippet with `<?php snippet('scss') ?>` in your HTML head.

## Using SCSS plugin

After installing and setting up this plugin, `assets/css/*.css`-files will be overwritten automatically. 

## Options

All options require **`heineref.scssphp.`** as prefix.

**`scssNestedCheck`**

    - default: `false`
    - If true, the plugin checks if partials are changed. If any partial is newer than the main SCSS file, the main SCSS file will be 'touched'. This will trigger the compiler, on this server and also an another environment when synced.
    - Look at "`Setup 5.`" for details!

**`scssDeveloperRoles`**

    - default: `['admin']`
    - Only these roles use the **NOT minified** CSS and can access the corresponding SourceMap.

**`scssDevelopment`**

    - default: `false`
    - If true, the CSS file is build EVERY time the **SCSSPHP** plugin runs

## Compatibility

Sass is a **CSS** preprocessor language that adds many features such as variables, mixins, imports, nesting, color manipulation, functions, and control directives.

For a complete guide to the syntax of Sass, please consult the [official documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation).

Please note that the used version of the **scssphp** compiler is not yet fully compatible with the Sass specification. Sass modules are also not yet implemented.

## Prospects

I plan to upgrade to version 2.x of the **scssphp** compiler. However, this requires a complete overhaul of the snippets `snippets/scss.php` and `snippets/scss.critical.php`, as the call to the **scssphp** compiler and the transfer of paths and options have changed completely with this version change.

However, this will take some longer time. A pull request at https://github.com/HeinerEF/kirby-scssphp/pulls would be welcome.

## Requirements

This plugin was built using **Kirby 5.x** and tested with **Kirby 4.x**. 

It may work with earlier versions. Otherwise, take a look at https://github.com/bartvandebiezen/kirby-v2-scssphp
